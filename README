[COOL NAME HERE]: Minecraft map to quake3 map converter
-------------------------------------------------------

The datafiles needed is generated by the old minecraft alpha server (1.10.1) 
which can be obtained here: http://www.minecraft.net/minecraft-server.zip
Start the server, stop the server, unpack server_level.dat, use it as indata to 
this application, generate 256x256 level, load it up in radiant, add skybox and
info_player_start, start q3map2 compile, go on a two week vacation. Hopefully
when you get back you have a working .bsp.

I generated a 110x110 block big map and it is already at the VIS stage limits for
the q3map2 compile. There are no textures included in this converter so you need
to grab them youself. I used google + imagemagick to find a nice texture pack and 
convert it to a usable format.

Sadly I lost track of what texture pack I used so I cannot thank the maker of it
(or ask for permission to use it). If you have no problems with using a public 
texture pack for this purpose you can extract the one I used from this pk3:

Enough of this ramble, lets get down to business!

STATUS:
-------
* Can convert the alpha map format (the ungzipped server.dat) to quake3 .map format. 
* Only terrain is converted. 
* Some brush optimization is done. 

TODO:
-----
* Cleanup and refactoring
* Some tests on the input file
* Working x- and y- offset
* Optimize by faces rather than optimize by brushes (and adding it as an option) 
* Convert objects, like flowers and torches, and represent them as md3-models

NEED_HELP_WITH:
---------------
* Parsing of the new region format (.mcr) to some suitable input to this program
* md3-models of mushroom, flowers etc...
